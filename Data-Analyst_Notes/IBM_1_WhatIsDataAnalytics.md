## DATA PROFESSIONALS ##

" In simple terms: Data engineering converts raw data into usable data. Data analytics uses this data to generate insights. Data scientists use data analytics and data engineering to predict the future using data from the past. Business analysts and business intelligence analysts use these insights and predictions to drive decisions that benefit and grow their business. "

- DATA ENGINEER: 
    · Develop and maintain data architectures and make data available for business operations and analysis.
    · Extract, integrate and organize data from dispare sources.
    · Clean, transform and prepare data desing, store and manage data in data repositories.
    · Enabled data to be accessible in formats and systems that the various business applications as well as stakeholders (DA & DS) can utilize. 
    · Must have good knowledge of programming, sound knowledge of systems and technology architectures, and in depth understanding of relational databases and non-relational data stores.

- DATA ANALYST: 
    · Translates data and numbers into plain language, so organizations can make decisions.
    · Inspect and clean data for deriving insights: identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mined data.
    · Visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis.
    · Analyst are the people who answer questions.
    · Require good knowledge of spreadsheets, writing queries, and using statistical tools to create charts and dashboards. Also need to have some programming skills. And strong analytical and storytelling skills.

- DATA SCIENTIST: 
    · Analyze data for actionable insights and build machine learning or deep learning models that train on past data to create predictive models. Plus, they need to have domain knowledge.
    · Require knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and a fair understanding of programming languages, databases, and building data models.

- BUSINESS ANALYST: 
    · Leverage the work of data analysts and data scientists to look at possible implications for their business and the actions they need to take or recommend.
    · Provide business intelligent solutions by organizing and monitoring data on different business functions and exploring that data to extract insights and actionables that improve business performance.

- BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST:
    · Do the same except their focus is on the market forces and external influences that shape their business.


## TYPES of Data Analysis ##

- DESCRIPTIVE Analytics: Helps answer questions about "what happened?" over a given period of time by summarizing past data and presenting the findings to stakeholders. It helps provide essential insights into past events. For example, tracking past performance based on the organization's key performance indicators or cash flow analysis. 

- DIAGNOSTIC Analytics: Helps answer the question "Why did it happen?". It takes the insights from descriptive analytics to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome. For example, a sudden change in traffic to a website without an obvious cause or an increase in sales in a region where there has been no change in marketing. 

- PREDICTIVE Analytics: Helps answer the question "What will happen next?". Historical data and trends are used to predict future outcomes. Some of the areas in which businesses apply predictive analysis are risk assessment and sales forecasts. It's important to note that the purpose of predictive analytics is not to say what will happen in the future, it's objective is to forecast what might happen in the future. All predictions are probabilistic in nature. 

- PRESCRIPTIVE Analytics: Helps answer the question "What should be done about it?". By analyzing past decisions and events, the likelihood of different outcomes. Is estimated on the basis of which a course of action is decided. Self-driving cars are a good example, they analyze the environment to make decisions regarding speed, changing lanes, which route to take, etc. Or airlines automatically adjusting ticket prices based on customer demand. Gas prices, the weather or traffic on connecting routes.

## STEPS in a Data Analysis ##

- Understanding the problem and desired result (that needs to be achieved): Where you are and where you want to be needs to be clearly defined before the analysis process can begin. 

- Setting a clear metric: Deciding what will be measured. 

- Gathering data: Identify the data you require, the data sources you need to pull this data from, and the best tools for the job. 

- Cleaning data: Fix quality issues in the data that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. Clean the data for missing or incomplete values and outliers. Standardize the data coming in from multiple sources. (This is a critical step because the accuracy of the analysis can only be ensured if the data is clean.)

- Analyzing and mining data: Extract and analyze the data from different perspectives. Manipulate the data in several different ways to understand the trends, identify correlations and find patterns and variations. 

- Interpreting results: Evaluate if your analysis is defendable against objections, and if there are any limitations or circumstances under which your analysis may not hold true. 

- Presenting your findings: The goal of any analysis is to impact decision making. The ability to communicate and present your findings in clear and impactful ways in reports, dashboards, charts, graphs, maps, case studies, etc.


### VOCABULARY ###

The terms Data Analysis and  Data Analytics are often used interchangeably. However, the dictionary meanings are:

Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something

Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics

There is a technical difference. Analysis can be done without numbers or data, such as business analysis, psycho analysis, etc. Whereas Analytics, even when used without the prefix "Data", almost invariably implies use of data for perfoming numerical manipulation and inference.



# THE DATA ANALYST ROLE #

## RESPONSABILITIES ##

    " Hi. I’m Sivaram Jaladi. I work as a Data Analyst with Fluentgrid, a smart grid technology solutions company based in Vishakhapatnam in India. Fluentgrid is an IBM partner and the recipient of IBM Beacon awards for its solutions in the areas of smart energy and smart city industry segments. We offer integrated operations center solutions for power utilities and smart cities, leveraging our actionable intelligence platform known as Fluentgrid Actilligence. Our client, a power utility company in South India, has been noticing a spike in complaints regarding overbilling. And the frequency of these complaints seems to suggest there’s something more to it than random occurrences. So, I’m asked to look at the complaints and the billing data and see if I can spot something. I start by taking stock of what I have. Some of the obvious places that I know I’m going to be looking into is the complaint data, the subscriber information data, and the billing data. That’s going to be my starting point. Before I dive into the specifics of the data, I’m going to make a list of questions, initial hypotheses, that I am going to start with. Such as the usage pattern of subscribers reporting this issue: Is there a consumption range for which overbilling is occurring more than others? Area-wise concentration of complaints: Are the complaints concentrated in specific localities within the city? Frequency and occurrence of complaints based on individual subscribers: Are the same subscribers reporting overbilling repetitively? If yes, what is the frequency of occurrence in repeat cases? If a subscriber is overbilled once, does the overbilling occur every month from the first occurrence, or are repeat occurrences sporadic, or not at all? As I get clear on my initial hypotheses and the set of questions I’m going to start with, I identify the datasets that I am going to isolate and analyze to validate or refute my hypotheses. I pull out the average annual, quarterly, and monthly billing amounts of the complainants and look for a range in which the complaints are falling more than others. I then pull up the location data of the complainants to see if there is a connection between overbilling and zip codes. Here I see what seems to be a concentration of complaints in certain areas. This looked like it could add up to something. So instead of moving to the third hypothesis, I decide to get a little deeper into this data. Next, I pull out the date of connection data. More than 95% of the complainants had been our subscribers for more than seven years, though not all subscribers over the 7-year mark were facing this complaint. So now, we see some area-wise concentration, and we see a significant concentration of complaints based on the date of connection. Next, I pull out the make and the serial number of the meters. And there it is — the serial numbers belonged to the same batch of meters provided by the same supplier. The concentration of these meters, and therefore the complaints, was coming from areas in which these meters were installed. At this stage, I feel confident in presenting these findings to the stakeholders. I’m also going to share the data sources and my process of arriving at this analysis — that always goes a long way in lending credibility to the findings. This could be the end of this project, or it may very well come back. Maybe the same complaints with different commonalities, or a completely different set of complaints for which we need to find answers. "
